As with all software involving automation of interactions with web servers, please be considerate of how often you run this software to minimize burden on E-Services servers.

Although this software is licensed under a public domain license and may be used without license restriction, this software was developed with humanitarian and charitable purposes in mind, with the intention of allowing tenant advocates to monitor and conduct outreach to tenants at risk of homelessness.
